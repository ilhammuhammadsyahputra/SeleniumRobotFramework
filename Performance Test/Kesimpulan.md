The provided test plan results show the performance test results for a website with a thread group of 750 threads. The test consists of four main actions: accessing the homepage, shop page, checkout process, and viewing results in a table. The test was run multiple times, and the results were written to a file for analysis.

Here are some key observations from the test results:

1. The average response time for accessing the homepage is 4069 milliseconds (ms), while for the shop page, it is 374 ms. The checkout process has an average response time of 260 ms. These response times indicate that the website performs better for the shop page and checkout process compared to the homepage.
2. The deviation in response times varies for each action. The homepage has a higher deviation of 1941 ms, while the shop page and checkout process have lower deviations of 946 ms and 89 ms, respectively. This indicates that the homepage has more variability in response times compared to the other actions.
3. The test results show that there were no errors during the test, indicating that the website performed well during the test.

In conclusion, the performance test results show that the website performs well, with no errors and acceptable response times. However, there is room for improvement in reducing the variability in response times for the homepage. Overall, the test results provide valuable insights into the website's performance and can help identify areas for optimization.
